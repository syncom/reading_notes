# The God Equation by Michio Kaku

## Chapter 0: Introduction to the Final Theory

- The leading candidate to the unified field theory (UFT) is called
string theory, which posits the universe was not made of point particles
but of tiny vibrating strings, with each note corresponding to a
subatomic particle.

- New forces unraveled that changed the course of civilization include

  - (Newton): laws of motion and gravity
  - (Faraday and Maxwell): laws of electricity and magnetism
  - (Einstein): theory of relativity
  - (Schroedinger, Heisenberg, et al) Quantum theory

  - Four natural forces the UFT would cover

    - Gravity
    - Electromagnetic force
    - Strong nuclear force
    - Weak nuclear force

- Two most important critisms of string theory

  - There's no solid, testable evidence, in spite of the Higgs boson
  found by the LHC
  - It predicts a multiverse of universes

## Chapter 1: Unification - The Ancient Dream

- Even today most of our advanced science is done indirectly.

- At least two great theories of our world emerged from ancient Greece:

  1. Everything consists of invisible, indestructible atoms (Democritus)
  2. The diversity of nature can be described by the mathematics of
  vibrations (Pythagoras)

- 1643: The year Newton was born, and Galileo died.

- Kaku: "Isaac Newton is perhaps the greatest scientist who ever lived."

- Physicist Steven Weinberg: "It is with Isaac Newton that the modern
dream of a final theory really begins."

- Faraday invented the concept of a field. Today all the known forces of
the universe are expressed in the language of fields.

- Maxwell realized that the behavior of electricity and magnetism could
be summarized in precise mathematical language, with vector calculus.

- Oscillating electric and magnetic fields turn into each other and move
like a wave. Light is one manifestation of an electromagnetic wave.

- Maxwell's equations contain the symmetry called duality. This duality
implies that electricity and magnetism are two manifestations of the
same force.

- The wavelength of an EM wave is roughly the size of the antenna that
produces it.

- Edison did not fully understand Maxwell's equations. This would be a
very costly mistake. Edison lost the DC vs AC battle with Tesla. AC
current can easily change voltage using transformers; but DC current
cannot.

- Physicists in the late 19th century did not realize that Newton's and
Maxwell's equations were actually incompatible.

- Einstein was born the year that Maxwell died, 1879.

## Chapter 2: Einstein's Quest for Unification

- G. H. Hardy wrote, "A mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the
poets, must be *beautiful*; the ideas, like the colors or the words, must fit
together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test; there is no permanent
place in the world for ugly mathematics." and that beauty is symmetry.

- Einstein's equations are symmetric in four dimensions.

- Einstein had the observation that gravitational attraction was actually an
illusion. *Gravity does not pull; space pushes.* General relativity says:
space-time is warped by heavy masses, causing the illusion of gravitational
force.

- Max Planck: "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its
opponents and making them see the light, but rather because the opponents
eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."

- Special relativity implies that higher speeds result in slower time. General
relativity implies that the weaker the gravitational pull, the faster time
moves.

- Over the decades, the quantum theory has met every experimental challenge and
has given us a deluge of wondrous electrical appliances that fill up our lives
and workspaces.

## Chapter 3: Rise of the Quantum

- To a physicist, infinity is just a sign that the equations aren't
working, that they don't understand what is happening.

- Planck's constant, h, is `6.6 x 10^{-34}` Joule-seconds.

- The Planck's constant was found by Planck by adjusting the energy of
quanta by hand, until he could perfectly fit the data.

- If we let the Planck's constant gradually go to zero, then all the
equations of the quantum theory reduce to the equations of Newton.

- Light has two faces, both as a particle and as a wave. So does the
electron.

- Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger wrote down his celebrated
equation that precisely described the motion of the particle waves. The
entire Mendeleyev table could in principle be explained as a solution of
the Schrodinger equation.

- According to Schrodinger, the electron is a wave that surrounds the
tiny nucleus.

- No matter how powerful the Schrodinger equation was, it only worked
for small velocities, said nothing about how electrons interact with
light via Maxwell's equations, and lacked the beautiful symmetry of
Einstein's theory and was rather ugly and difficult to handle
mathematically. All the ugly terms in the original Schrodinger equation
collapsed into a simple four-dimensional equation by Dirac. Dirac's
theory combined time and space, and had a four-dimensional symmetry.

- Dirac's equations predicted the electron to have a spin that created a
magnetic field of its own. They predicted an unexpected new form of
matter, called antimatter.

- Anti-electron is called positron.

- According to a paper by Max Born in 1926, what was waving was the
probability of finding an electron at that point.

- "The more successful the quantum theory becomes, the sillier it looks"
-- Einstein.

- On two sides of the quantum debate: 1) Einstein and Schrodinger, 2)
Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. Historians agree for the most part
that Bohr and the quantum rebels won the debate. Still, Einstein was
successful in exposing the cracks in the foundation of quantum
mechanics.

- Predictions of the quantum theory have been tested to eleven decimal
places, making it the most accurate theory of all time.

- Bohr's interpretation that the true Schrodinger's cat emerges only
because observation causes the wave of the cat to collapse has fallen
into disfavor; what has become more popular is the multiverse
interpretation, where the universe splits in half, with on half
containing a dead cat and the other containing a live cat.

- Franklin Roosevelt authorized the largest scientific project in
history, the Manhattan Project. Back in Germany, Heisenberg was
appointed to be the head of the Nazi atomic bomb project.

- The "critical mass", i.e., the amount of enriched uranium or plutonium
necessary to create a chain reaction, is roughly 20 pounds of
uranium-235.

## Chapter 4: Theory of Almost Everything

- Einstein's guiding principles

  - Special relativity: The theory had to remain the same when
  interchanging X, Y, Z and T.
  - General relativity: Gravity and acceleration could be the same.
  - Unified field theory: He could find none.

- As Bohr implied, all the easy, obvious theories had been tried by
Einstein and his associates, and they all failed. Therefore, the true
UFT must be radically different from all previous approaches. It must be
"crazy enough" to qualify as a true theory of everything.

- QED: quantum electrodynamics, is the theory to combine Dirac's theory
of the electron with Maxwell's theory of light that obeys quantum
mechanics and the special relativity.

- A theory combining Dirac electrons with general relativity was
considered to be much too difficult.

- In 1949, the QED was cracked independently, by Richard Feynman, Julian
Schwinger, and Shin'Ichiro Tomonaga. Their method is called
renormalization theory. The method is supremely ugly. One has to master
an encyclopedia of mathematical tricks in order to cancel thousands of
terms. But you cannot argue with results.

- Julian Schwinger's first regular academic appointment was at Purdue
University in 1941.

- Transistor and laser are two by-products of the quantum theory.

- In one of the most important papers published in the twentieth
century, Watson and Crick were able to use quantum mechanics to decode
the entire structure of the DNS molecule.

-is a clumsy, imprecise operation, yet one of the only ways we have to study
the nuclear force.

- Strong nuclear force: Murray Gell-Mann quark model was able to unify
subatomic particles inside protons and neutrons. Gell-Mann's equations
containing three quarks are symmetric.

- Weak nuclear force: A neutron is unstable, and eventually decays into
a proton and an electron. This is called beta decay. In order for the
calculation to work out, a third particle, called the neutrino was
introduced. The electron and neutrino were a pair of weakly interacting
particles, and were paired to form a symmetry. This new symmetry was
coupled to the older symmetry of Maxwell's theory to construct the
electroweak theory, which unified electromagnetism with the weak nuclear
force.

- What holds the atom together is the electric field, described by
Maxwell's equations. What holds the quarks together is a generalization
of Maxwell's equations, i.e, the Yang-Mills fields. Yang-Mills theory
required quarks coming in three types (colors), obeying Gell-Mann's
three-quark symmetry.

- When applied to quarks, the Yang-Mills field was called the gluon. The
Yang-Mills field describing the interaction between electrons and
neutrinos is called the W and Z particles.

- QCD: quantum chromodynamics today represents the best-known
representation of the nuclear force.

- The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is the theory describing
three of the four known fundamental forces (the electromagnetic, weak,
and strong interactions, while omitting gravity) in the universe, as
well as classifying all known elementary particles.

- The Standard Model could accurately predict the properties of matter
all the way back to a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. However,
it also had a numerous glaring holes.

  - SM made no mention of gravity
  - SM was a patchwork
  - SM had a number of parameters that were undetermined
  - SM is very clumsy

- LHC (Large Hadron Collider) was the largest machine of science ever
build. The goal of the LHC is to duplicate the conditions found shortly
after the Big Bang, and thereby to create these unstable particles. It
found the Higgs Boson in 2012.

- The introduction of graviton to form the theory of everything failed,
and the quantum corrections created by gravitons were infinite, and
could not be reabsorbed elsewhere. Unable to create a quantum theory of
gravity, physicists began to try a more modest goal: calculate what
happens when ordinary things are quantized, leaving gravity alone.

## Chapter 5: The Dark Universe

- In 1783, an astronomer named John Michell asked himself a question:
What happens if the escape velocity is the speed of light? This was
probably the first thought on a black hole.

- Oppenheimer and his student Snyder showed that black holes could form
from natural processes that Einstein did not foresee.

- Our sun is not massive enough to undergo a supernova explosion, and
its event horizon is about four miles across. No known natural process
can squeeze our sun down to two miles, and hence our sun will not become
a black hole.

- There are two types of black holes: The first type is the remnant of a
giant star. The second type is found at the center of galaxies.

- At the center of the Milky Way galaxy lies a monster black hole whose
mass is two to four million times that of our sun.

- Stephen Hawking's life's goal was to apply quantum theory to gravity.
The question he asked was" What happens when you combine the quantum
theory and Einstein's equations and apply quantum mechanics to a black
hole (so he could ignore the too difficult problem of quantum
corrections of the gravitons)?

- Hawking's discovery: Even black holes have a finite lifetime - they
will eventually evaporate.

- Hawking initially thought quantum mechanics breaks down in a black
hole, then conceded that perhaps he was wrong. Whether information is
lost in a black hole is still an ongoing question, fiercely debated
among physicists.

- In 1963, mathematician Roy Kerr found an entirely new solution to
Einstein's equations for a rotating black hole, which predicted a
wormhole.

- "Everything not forbidden is compulsory" -- T. H. White. Physicists
take this statement seriously.

- Creating a wormhole in a laboratory poses daunting problems

  - Vast amount of positive energy is needed. This alone would require
  the technology of a very advanced civilization.
  - Negative matter or negative energy is needed to keep the wormhole
  stable. Physicists have never seen negative matter. Only a minuscule
  amount of negative energy exists.
  - Radiation from gravity itself might be enough to cause the wormhole
  to explode.

- Only a theory of everything can tell us what lies on the other side of
the black hole, and if time travel is possible, by calculating quantum
correction to gravity via gravitons.

- Einstein admitted that the cosmological constant was his "greatest
blunder". The cosmological constant has made a comeback in recent years.

- The greatest minds of the century have tried to solve the problem of
applying the SM to gravity, but no one has been successful. Clearly, an
entirely new approach must be used, since all the easy ideas have been
investigated and discarded.

## Chapter 6: Rise of String Theory: Promise and Problems

- In 1968, two young physicists, Gabriele Veneziano and Mahiko Suzuki
found Leonhard Euler's formula seems to describe the scattering of two
subatomic particles. Later Yoichiro Nambu, Holger Nielsen, and Leonard
Susskind realized that the properties of this formula represented the
interaction of two strings. This sparked the string theory.

- Kaku and his colleague Keiji Kikkawa wrote all string theory in the
language of fields, creating what is called string field theory.

- In string theory, gravity is necessarily included.

- Sting theory can only exist in ten dimensions.

- In spite of all craziness of string theory, one thing that kept it
alive is that it successfully marries the two great theories of physics,
general relativity and the quantum theory, giving up a finite theory of
quantum gravity.

- Particles having integral spin describe the forces of the universe,
and are named bosons. Bosons are named after Indian physicist Bose.
Particles having half-integral spin describe the matter of the universe,
and are named fermions. Fermions are named after Enrico Fermi.

- String theory has a new type of symmetry, called supersymmetry.
Supersymmetry is now the largest symmetry ever found in physics. Each
particle has a super partner, called a *sparticle*.

- The M-theory unified five versions of string theories, and is an
eleven-dimensional theory.

- "Remarkable claims require remarkable proof" -- Carl Sagan.

- The energy that gravitons possess is called the Planck energy, which
is quadrillion times greater than the energy produced by the LHC. One
would probably need a particle accelerator the size of the galaxy for a
**direct test** of the string theory.

- Most of the universe is hidden from us, in the form of dark matter and
dark energy.

- String theory has an infinite number of solutions, each describing a
perfectly well-behaved finite theory of gravity, which do not resemble
our universe at all.

- The anthropic principle says that our universe is special, because we,
as conscious beings, are here to discuss this question in the first
place.

- Kaku has a point that perhaps *we do not need an experimental proof of
string theory at all*. A theory of everything is also a theory of
ordinary things.

## Chapter 7: Finding Meaning in The Universe

- Each solution of the theory of everything is an entire universe. The
energy at which the theory becomes relevant is the Planck energy.

- Einstein wrote that there are really two kinds of Gods. The first is
the personal God. The second is the God of Spinoza, i.e., the God of
order in a universe that is beautiful, simple, and elegant. He believed
in the latter, but not the former.

- Physics says nothing about where the laws of physics themselves come
from. It's the job of metaphysics.

- The bedrock of our understanding of the world is science, which is
ultimately based on things that are testable., reproducible,
falsifiable. However, there are some things beyond the realm of science.
For example, it is impossible to prove a negative.

- We create our own meaning in the universe.

- In an open universe, where energy can enter from the outside, it is
possible to reverse the second law of thermodynamics.
