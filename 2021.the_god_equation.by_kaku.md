# The God Equation by Michio Kaku

## Chapter 0: Introduction to the Final Theory

- The leading candidate to the unified field theory (UFT) is called
string theory, which posits the universe was not made of point particles
but of tiny vibrating strings, with each note corresponding to a
subatomic particle.

- New forces unraveled that changed the course of civilization include

  - (Newton): laws of motion and gravity
  - (Faraday and Maxwell): laws of electricity and magnetism
  - (Einstein): theory of relativity
  - (Schroedinger, Heisenberg, et al) Quantum theory

  - Four natural forces the UFT would cover

    - Gravity
    - Electromagnetic force
    - Strong nuclear force
    - Weak nuclear force

- Two most important critisms of string theory

  - There's no solid, testable evidence, in spite of the Higgs boson
  found by the LHC
  - It predicts a multiverse of universes

## Chapter 1: Unification - The Ancient Dream

- Even today most of our advanced science is done indirectly.

- At least two great theories of our world emerged from ancient Greece:

  1. Everything consists of invisible, indestructible atoms (Democritus)
  2. The diversity of nature can be described by the mathematics of
  vibrations (Pythagoras)

- 1643: The year Newton was born, and Galileo died.

- Kaku: "Isaac Newton is perhaps the greatest scientist who ever lived."

- Physicist Steven Weinberg: "It is with Isaac Newton that the modern
dream of a final theory really begins."

- Faraday invented the concept of a field. Today all the known forces of
the universe are expressed in the language of fields.

- Maxwell realized that the behavior of electricity and magnetism could be summarized in precise mathematical language, with vector calculus.

- Oscillating electric and magnetic fields turn into each other and move
like a wave. Light is one manifestation of an electromagnetic wave.

- Maxwell's equations contain the symmetry called duality. This duality
implies that electricity and magnetism are two manifestations of the
same force.

- The wavelength of an EM wave is roughly the size of the antenna that
produces it.

- Edison did not fully understand Maxwell's equations. This would be a
very costly mistake. Edison lost the DC vs AC battle with Tesla. AC
current can easily change voltage using transformers; but DC current
cannot.

- Physicists in the late 19th century did not realize that Newton's and
Maxwell's equations were actually incompatible.

- Einstein was born the year that Maxwell died, 1879.

## Chapter 2: Einstein's Quest for Unification

- G. H. Hardy wrote, "A mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the
poets, must be *beautiful*; the ideas, like the colors or the words, must fit
together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test; there is no permanent
place in the world for ugly mathematics." and that beauty is symmetry.

- Einstein's equations are symmetric in four dimensions.

- Einstein had the observation that gravitational attraction was actually an
illusion. *Gravity does not pull; space pushes.* General relativity says:
space-time is warped by heavy masses, causing the illusion of gravitational
force.

- Max Planck: "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its
opponents and making them see the light, but rather because the opponents
eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."

- Special relativity implies that higher speeds result in slower time. General
relativity implies that the weaker the gravitational pull, the faster time
moves.

- Over the decades, the quantum theory has met every experimental challenge and
has given us a deluge of wondrous electrical appliances that fill up our lives
and workspaces.

## Chapter 3: Rise of the Quantum

- To a physicist, infinity is just a sign that the equations aren't
working, that they don't understand what is happening.

- Planck's constant, h, is `6.6 x 10^{-34}` Joule-seconds.

- The Planck's constant was found by Planck by adjusting the energy of
quanta by hand, until he could perfectly fit the data.

- If we let the Planck's constant gradually go to zero, then all the
equations of the quantum theory reduce to the equations of Newton.

- Light has two faces, both as a particle and as a wave. So does the
electron.

- Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger wrote down his celebrated
equation that precisely described the motion of the particle waves. The
entire Mendeleyev table could in principle be explained as a solution of
the Schrodinger equation.

- According to Schrodinger, the electron is a wave that surrounds the
tiny nucleus.

- No matter how powerful the Schrodinger equation was, it only worked
for small velocities, said nothing about how electrons interact with
light via Maxwell's equations, and lacked the beautiful symmetry of
Einstein's theory and was rather ugly and difficult to handle
mathematically. All the ugly terms in the original Schrodinger equation
collapsed into a simple four-dimensional equation by Dirac. Dirac's
theory combined time and space, and had a four-dimensional symmetry.

- Dirac's equations predicted the electron to have a spin that created a
magnetic field of its own. They predicted an unexpected new form of
matter, called antimatter.

- Anti-electron is called positron.

- According to a paper by Max Born in 1926, what was waving was the
probability of finding an electron at that point.

- "The more successful the quantum theory becomes, the sillier it looks"
-- Einstein.

- On two sides of the quantum debate: 1) Einstein and Schrodinger, 2)
Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. Historians agree for the most part
that Bohr and the quantum rebels won the debate. Still, Einstein was
successful in exposing the cracks in the foundation of quantum
mechanics.

- Predictions of the quantum theory have been tested to eleven decimal
places, making it the most accurate theory of all time.

- Bohr's interpretation that the true Schrodinger's cat emerges only
because observation causes the wave of the cat to collapse has fallen
into disfavor; what has become more popular is the multiverse
interpretation, where the universe splits in half, with on half
containing a dead cat and the other containing a live cat.

- Franklin Roosevelt authorized the largest scientific project in
history, the Manhattan Project. Back in Germany, Heisenberg was
appointed to be the head of the Nazi atomic bomb project.

- The "critical mass", i.e., the amount of enriched uranium or plutonium
necessary to create a chain reaction, is roughly 20 pounds of
uranium-235.
