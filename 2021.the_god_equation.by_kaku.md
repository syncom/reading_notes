# The God Equation by Michio Kaku

## Chapter 0: Introduction to the Final Theory

- The leading candidate to the unified field theory (UFT) is called
string theory, which posits the universe was not made of point particles
but of tiny vibrating strings, with each note corresponding to a
subatomic particle.

- New forces unraveled that changed the course of civilization include

  - (Newton): laws of motion and gravity
  - (Faraday and Maxwell): laws of electricity and magnetism
  - (Einstein): theory of relativity
  - (Schroedinger, Heisenberg, et al) Quantum theory

  - Four natural forces the UFT would cover

    - Gravity
    - Electromagnetic force
    - Strong nuclear force
    - Weak nuclear force

- Two most important critisms of string theory

  - There's no solid, testable evidence, in spite of the Higgs boson
  found by the LHC
  - It predicts a multiverse of universes

## Chapter 1: Unification - The Ancient Dream

- Even today most of our advanced science is done indirectly.

- At least two great theories of our world emerged from ancient Greece:

  1. Everything consists of invisible, indestructible atoms (Democritus)
  2. The diversity of nature can be described by the mathematics of
  vibrations (Pythagoras)

- 1643: The year Newton was born, and Galileo died.

- Kaku: "Isaac Newton is perhaps the greatest scientist who ever lived."

- Physicist Steven Weinberg: "It is with Isaac Newton that the modern
dream of a final theory really begins."

- Faraday invented the concept of a field. Today all the known forces of
the universe are expressed in the language of fields.

- Maxwell realized that the behavior of electricity and magnetism could be summarized in precise mathematical language, with vector calculus.

- Oscillating electric and magnetic fields turn into each other and move
like a wave. Light is one manifestation of an electromagnetic wave.

- Maxwell's equations contain the symmetry called duality. This duality
implies that electricity and magnetism are two manifestations of the
same force.

- The wavelength of an EM wave is roughly the size of the antenna that
produces it.

- Edison did not fully understand Maxwell's equations. This would be a
very costly mistake. Edison lost the DC vs AC battle with Tesla. AC
current can easily change voltage using transformers; but DC current
cannot.

- Physicists in the late 19th century did not realize that Newton's and
Maxwell's equations were actually incompatible.

- Einstein was born the year that Maxwell died, 1879.
