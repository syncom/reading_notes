# “名家芯思维”之2017年物联网核心技术和应用国际研讨会

会议地点：深圳威尼斯睿途酒店1楼威尼斯厅

September 5, 2017

------------------------------
Morning Session
------------------------------
9:30am Tom Lee at Stanford University

* Silicon is the New Steel (the good and the bad)

The good: Silicon technologies develop fast

The bad:
Moore's law is over! (We're in the last stages of Moore's Law)

Facts:
- There are now >7.1 billion mobile subscriptions (>100% of the human
  population)
- A race to the bottom: "Jugate" phone, 55 RMB quad-band GSM feature phone
  with camera and qq

The thesis of the talk: as the evolutionary rate of silicon technology slows,
the rules of the game are shifting fundamentally; those who can innovate at
high velocity will have a powerful advantage.

10:20am 吕浩 at NXP

* NXP Leads Next-Gen Domain Based Architectures

90%的汽车创新来自电子设备
- 无缝互联，出行体验
- 由ADAS迈向自动驾驶
- 节能减排

11:00am Yaohong Liu at IMEC

* The RF design challenges in 5G for machine type communications (MTC)

How things connect to the internet:
LPWA: low power wide area
- cellular
- LoRa

SRR: short range radios
- BLE
- Zigbee
- WiFi

This is a talk about the choices of RF design in 5G, with a lot of focus on
the digital communications side.

11:30am 朱西产 at Tongji Univ

* 智能网联汽车及其应用场景的分析

- 2016年我国汽车产量达到2811.9万辆
- 汽车依赖石油进口

车联网安全问题。这里的安全主要讲的是safety。

12:18pm 周立功 at 广州致远电子有限公司

* PaaS (Platform as a Service)

利润模型：利润-需求-设计

公司成功靠需求，降低成本

节省成本的额方法之一：代码复用，跨平台

AWorks平台设计思路：抽象共性
- 基础类库
- 第三方组建库
- MVVM GUI框架
- etc

AMetal框架：底层服务

AWPI应用编程框架

Afternoon Session
------------------------------
2:00pm Yunan Gong at NXP
* Functional Safety of Automotive Semiconductor

The speaker talks about how to implement safety development at NXP. To me,
safety analysis is pretty much similar to security analysis; safety manual is
just like a security product manual. However, the talk focuses heavily on
safety certification as it goes.

ISO26262 

The talk went boringly overtime.

3:00pm Johnny Chen at NXP
* Automotive Security Gateway

Unlike the previous talk, this is a talk on security.

An automotive gateway is similar to a home gateway.

CAN was not designed considering security. 

Four stages of vehicles:

Legacy -> Trending -> Future. This talk is about the later stage of trending
vehicles.

2012车载网络体系架构
Network Security
- High-perf contextual firewall
- IDS/IPS
- Seecure Messages
- Network key management

Car Hacking: security is a must-have
- Car-generated data may become a $750B market by 2030
- Up to 150 ECUs per car, up to 200M lines of sw code
- 250M connected vehicles on the road in 2020

The speaker showed a slide of risk analysis of car security.
