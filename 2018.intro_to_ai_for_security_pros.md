# Notes for "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for Security
# Professionals", by the Cylance Data Science Team

## Introduction

The field of AI encompasses three areas of research
- Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)
 * The goal is to produce computer with "perfect memory and unlimited
   analytical power"
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
 * Refers to machine as intelligent as a human, i.e., it is able to pass
   the "Turing Test"
 * Most experts agree we are at least decades away from AGI
- Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)
 * Exploits computer's superior ability to solve domain-specific
   problems with vast data difficult for impossible for a human to
   handle
 * This book focuses on a sub-area of this area, machine learning

# Chapter One: Clustering

Clustering refers to a variety of techniques for sub-dividing samples
into distinct sub-groups, or clusters, based on similarity among their
key features and attributes. 

Techniques discussed: K-mean and DBSCAN

Typical stages of a clustering procedure:
- Data selection and sampling
- Feature extraction
- Feature encoding and vectorization
- Model computation and graphing
- Model validation and testing


# Chapter Two: Classification

Classification refers to a set of computational methods for predicting
the likelihood that a given sample belongs to a predefined class.

Techniques discussed: Logistic regression and CART decision tree
algorithm

Typical phases of a supervised learning procedure:
- Model training
- Validation
- Testing
- Deployment

# Chapter Three: Probability

Probability is considered as a predicative modeling technique for
classifying and clustering sample.

Techniques discussed: Naive Bayes (NB) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

# Chapter Four: Deep Learning

Deep learning refers to a wide range of learning methods primarily based
on the use of neural networks.

Techniques discussed: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) type of neural networks.
