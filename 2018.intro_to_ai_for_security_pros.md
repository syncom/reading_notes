# Notes for "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for Security Professionals", by the Cylance Data Science Team

## Introduction

The field of AI encompasses three areas of research
- Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)
 * The goal is to produce computer with "perfect memory and unlimited
   analytical power"
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
 * Refers to machine as intelligent as a human, i.e., it is able to pass
   the "Turing Test"
 * Most experts agree we are at least decades away from AGI
- Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)
 * Exploits computer's superior ability to solve domain-specific
   problems with vast data difficult for impossible for a human to
   handle
 * This book focuses on a sub-area of this area, machine learning

## Chapter One: Clustering

Clustering refers to a variety of techniques for sub-dividing samples
into distinct sub-groups, or clusters, based on similarity among their
key features and attributes. 

Techniques discussed: K-mean and DBSCAN

Typical stages of a clustering procedure:
- Data selection and sampling
- Feature extraction
- Feature encoding and vectorization
- Model computation and graphing
- Model validation and testing


### K-mean
- Hyperparameter: K
- Easy and works many times

Limitations:
- With randomly chosen initial centroids, the algorithm may not converge
- Defining "K" appropriately requires experience, patience and luck

### DBSCAN: Density-based Spatial Clustering of an Application with Noise

It constructs clusters in regions where vectors are most densely packed
and considers points in sparser regions to be noise. It
- discovers the number of clusters to create
- can construct clusters of any shape and size

DBSCAN hyperparameters: Epsilon (Eps) and Minimum Points (MinPts)

- Eps: radius of the point's neighborhood
- MinPts: minimum number of points that must appear within an Eps
  neighborhood for the point inside to be included in cluster

DBSCAN assigns each point to one of three types:
- core point
- border point
- noise point

How to tune DBSCAN:
- Method 1: tune Eps and MinPts values
- Method 2: redefine Eps hyperparameter function by using different
  distance metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan or City Block, Cosine
  similarity

Limitations:
- Extremely sensitive to even small changes in MinPts and Eps settings
- High computational cost in high dimensional cases
- Poor performance w.r.t. datasets that result in regions of varying
  densities

## Silhouette score
The silhouette score (or silhouette value) is a measure of how similar
an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The silhouette
score ranges between -1 and 1; the higher the score, the better matched 
the object is to its cluster.

## Chapter Two: Classification

Classification refers to a set of computational methods for predicting
the likelihood that a given sample belongs to a predefined class.

Techniques discussed: Logistic regression and CART decision tree
algorithm

Typical phases of a supervised learning procedure:
- Model training
- Validation
- Testing
- Deployment

## Chapter Three: Probability

Probability is considered as a predicative modeling technique for
classifying and clustering sample.

Techniques discussed: Naive Bayes (NB) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

## Chapter Four: Deep Learning

Deep learning refers to a wide range of learning methods primarily based
on the use of neural networks.

Techniques discussed: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) type of neural networks.
