^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``A block cipher mode, or mode, for short, is an algorithm that features
the use of a symmetric key block cipher algorithm to provide an information
service, such as confidentiality or authentication.'' [2]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As of January 2011, there are 9 NIST approved block cipher modes [1, 2],
including
- Six (6) confidentiality modes:
  ECB, CBC, OFB, CFB, CTR, XTS-AES

- One (1) authentication mode:
  CMAC

- Two (2) combined modes for confidentiality and authentication:
  CCM, GCM

Descriptions of usage:

Confidentiality modes:
  ECB: Electronic Codebook

       Each block is encrypted separately.
       Both encryption and decryption
       can be computed in parallel. Not recommended in practice.


  CBC: Cipher Block Chaining

       Each ciphertext is dependent on all blocks processed up to this
       point.
       Needs an IV.
       Encryption is sequantial. Decryption can be computed in parallel.

  CFB: Cipher Feedback

       Self-synchronizing stream cipher.
       No padding needed.
       Needs an IV.
       Encryption is sequential.
       Decryption can be parallelized if the input blocks are first
       constructed from the IV and the ciphertext.


  OFB: Output Feedback

       Synchronous stream cipher. (Flipping one bit in ciphertext produces
       a flipped bit in the plaintext in the same location.)
       No padding needed.
       Needs a unique IV (nonce) for every message that is ever encrypted
       under the given key.
       Forward cipher function cannot be parallelized in encryption and
       decryption.

  CTR: Couter

       A block cipher turned into a stream cipher.
       No padding needed.
       Needs an IV/nonce.
       Both encryption and decryption can be performed in parallel.

Authentication mode:

  CMAC: Cipher-based MAC

        May be more appropriate for information systems in which an approved
        block cipher is more readily available than an approved hash
        function.

Authenticated encryption modes:

CCM: Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code

     Combines counter mode for confidentiality with cipher block chaining
     technique for authentication, using the same key.
     Need an IV/nonce.

GCM: Galois/Counter Mode

     Combines the counter mode for confidentiality with an authentication
     mechanism that is based on a universal hash function.
     Designed to faciliate high-throughput hardware implementations;
     software optimizations are also possible, if certain lookup tables
     can be precomputed from the key and stored in memory.
     Needs an IV that must satisfy a uniqueness requirement.
