# Toorcon San Diego, October 12, 2021

I got a virtual ticket to attend Toorcon this year in the middle of a pandemic.
A streaming link with a code was sent to me one day before the con started.

## Keynote: The Demise of the Cybersecurity Workforce (!?)

Speaker: G. Mark Hardy

Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Wisdom

It all comes down to people.

- 95% breaches are in three industries: government, retail, technology
- 95% breaches are due to human errors

Cybersecurity jobs:

- Level 1: Operators (button-pushers)
- Level 2: Analysts
- Level 3: Developers and Researchers
- Level 4: Cyber strategists
  - Deep understanding of cyber, geopolitics, economics

The average age of cyber security professionals is 42.

"Half of what you know about security will be obsolete in 18 months" -- G.
Mark's corollary to Moore's Law

Cyber demands ongoing knowledge.

Everything will be automated. Who programs the programmers?

## Fuzzers, analyzers, and other Gophers insecticides

Speaker: Alex Useche (Trail of Bits)

Common bugs in Go code. Focus on concurrency bugs.

- Omitted error handling
- Interface weirdness (return an interface passes nil check incorrectly)
- Integer overflows
- Concurrency bugs
  - data races
  - misuse of channels
  - goroutine leaks
  - deadlocks
  - missing unlocks

The insecticides

- Dynamic analysis: Requires running the code or binary
  - Fuzzing is easy in go
    - go-fuzz, gofuzz, /trailofbits/go-fuzz-utils, package fuzz
  - Fault injection
    - github.com/trailofbits/krf
    - Often useful to reveal error handling issues in Go
  - Other tools
    - Gopter
    - package testing
    - Go race detector
    - go-deadlock
- Static analysis
  - General approach
    - Generate an abstract interpretation of code
    - Remove stuff that's not important: Build AST
    - Do analysis on CFG
  - **AST based tooling**
    - gosec
    - errcheck
    - ineffassign
    - semgrep (the speaker's favorite; trailofbits/semgrep-rules)
    - ruleguard
    - Go analyzers
    - go vet
  - AST analysis with Go
    - package go/ast
  - Data flow analysis with Go
    - golang.org/x/tools/go/ssa
    - static single-assignment: IR representation used by Go
  - **SSA based tools**
    - github/codeql-go (steep learning curve, slow)
    - system-pclub/GCatch (finds concurrency bugs; helps the speaker find bugs in
    audits; a little hard to set up; low rate of false positives)
    - stripe-archive/safesql
    - go-kart
  - Misuse of non-native packages: tooling
    - semgrep for a lot of use cases
    - CodeQL for more in-depth analysis (slow)
  - The speaker is developing a new static analysis tool, Gotico, using AST and
  SSA to make it more flexible and easier to use than semgrep and CodeQL.

##  Sleight of ARM: Demystifying Intel Houdini

Speaker: Brian Hong of the NCC Group

Houdini:

- Intel's binary translator that runs ARM binaries on x86.
- Primarily used by Android on x86 platforms, such as higher-end
Chromebooks and desktop Android emulators.

The speaker talks about how he reverse engineered the internals of Houdini
(e.g., run libhoudini.so in Ghidra).

Some pro-tip for architecture checking:
- JNIEnv magic pointer detection works better than Java architecture
checking and memory mapping checking (because houdini hides the latter
two)

The speaker also gives some ideas (but not exploits) about how to escape into
x86.

The speaker runs a POC demo on a Chromebook.

## Getting Down with Bringup

Speaker: Gene Erik

It's a device secure boot talk. It provides information 

Bringup here means "getting the system running and I/O operational",
which the speaker calls "DevKit bring up".

Microcode -> Boot ROM -> BIOS/UEFI -> OS bootloaders (GRUB etc) -> init -> kernel

Bringup on ARM: (EL0)-(EL4)
Bringup on X86: (Ring -2)-(Ring 3)

On a Raspberry Pi 4, one can add a TPM over SPI. RPI has a
reconfigurable device tree.

## Making Mischief with Model Specific Registers

Speaker: John D Dunlap

Teach people about this attack surface - model specific registers
(MSRs). This talk is Windows specific, although the concept is
applicable elsewhere.

Low-quality gaming drivers may allow kernel exec.

Stare at the datasheet long enough, you may find vulnerabilities.

Some drivers may expose registers to *arbitrary MSR read and write*,
which are only supposed to be accessed in the kernel.

_xeroxz's tool (githacks.org/_xeroxz/msrexec) may be fun to play with.

MSR instructions: rdmsr, wrmsr

## Free as in Beer: Building a low cost static analysis program

Speaker: Erin Browning and Tim Faraci at Slack

Use semgrep, an open source static analysis engine with highly
configurable rules, and tune these rules to specific environment.

What are needed by Slack

1. A generic engine
2. Tunable rules
3. Fast

semgrep rules are yaml files. Slack's semgrep repo is called SNOW. Slack
is open sourcing the SNOW repo.

- Easy to maintain architecture
- Developers can create PRs to add (blacklist of) false positives
- Daily comparison and PR branch scan (Jenkins and then GHA)

Adding a new language to sempgrep is not difficult

- You need to understand syntax trees (concrete and abstract syntax
trees)
- You need to specify the grammar (with tree sitter) and write parsers
to get CST and AST
- Write the rules
