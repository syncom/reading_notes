# Toorcon San Diego, October 12, 2021

I got a virtual ticket to attend Toorcon this year in the middle of a pandemic.
A streaming link with a code was sent to me one day before the con started.

## Keynote: The Demise of the Cybersecurity Workforce (!?)

Speaker: G. Mark Hardy

Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Wisdom

It all comes down to people.

- 95% breaches are in three industries: goverment, retail, technology
- 95% breaches are due to human errors

Cybersecurity jobs:

- Level 1: Operators (button-pushers)
- Level 2: Analysts
- Level 3: Developers and Researchers
- Level 4: Cyber strategists
  - Deep understanding of cyber, geopolitics, economics

The average age of cyber security professionals is 42.

"Half of what you know about security will be obsolete in 18 months" -- G.
Mark's corollary to Moore's Law

Cyber demands ongoing knowledge.

Everything will be automated. Who programs the programmers?

## Fuzzers, analyzers, and other Gophers insecticides

Speaker: Alex Useche (Trail of Bits)

Common bugs in Go code. Focus on concurrency bugs.

- Omitted error handling
- Interface weirdness (return an interface passes nil check incorrectly)
- Integer overflows
- Concurrency bugs
  - data races
  - misuse of channels
  - goroutine leaks
  - deadlocks
  - missing unlocks

The insecticides

- Dynamic analysis: Requires running the code or binary
  - Fuzzing is easy in go
    - go-fuzz, gofuzz, /trailofbits/go-fuzz-utils, package fuzz
  - Fault injection
    - github.com/trailofbits/krf
    - Often useful to reveal error handling issues in Go
  - Other tools
    - Gopter
    - package testing
    - Go race detector
    - go-deadlock
- Static analysis
  - General approach
    - Generate an abstract interpretation of code
    - Remove stuff that's not important: Build AST
    - Do analysis on CFG
  - **AST based tooling**
    - gosec
    - errcheck
    - ineffassign
    - semgrep (the speaker's favorite; trailofbits/semgrep-rules)
    - ruleguard
    - Go analyzers
    - go vet
  - AST analysis with Go
    - package go/ast
  - Data flow analysis with Go
    - golang.org/x/tools/go/ssa
    - static single-assignment: IR representation used by Go
  - **SSA based tools**
    - github/codeql-go (steep learning curve, slow)
    - system-pclub/GCatch (finds corrency bugs; helps the speaker find bugs in
    audits; a little hard to set up; low rate of false postives)
    - stripe-archive/safesql
    - go-kart
  - Misuse of non-native packages: tooling
    - semgrep for a lot of use cases
    - CodeQL for more in-depth analysis (slow)
  - The speaker is developing a new static analysis tool, Gotico, using AST and
  SSA to make it more flexible and easier to use than semgrep and CodeQL.
